1.In vanilla javascript project we first installed typescript using: npm i typescript -g.
2.Than we create the main.ts file and enter our code. To compile it into javascript we use tsc main.ts.
3.We link the script of main.js to our html file.
4.Once we change something into our main.ts file, we have to recompile it. To automatically watch any change, we use: tsc main.ts -w. 5. We enter: tsc --init to initialize tsconfig.json file and go to the "rootDir": and specify the root of the ts file in our case we have it inside src folder in the root: "rootDir": "./src" .Than we specify the "outDir": "./build/js" , in our case we have the js file that will be compiled inside build folder , inside js folder. Than we simply run tsc -w to watch changes.
5.To prevent typescript file being created and compiled into js file but outside the src folder, we specify in the tsconfig by using : "include": ["src"]
6.To prevent compiling ts to js file on error, we use : "noEmitOnError": true
